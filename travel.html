      <h1>Seeing the world before 30</h1>
      <h2>My attempt to visit all 7 continents before I'm "old"</h2>

      <h3> Asia </h3>
      <p> I lived in Asia for three years when I was young.
        Living in Hong Kong gave me a taste for travel and adventure! I went
        back to Asia to vist a friend in 2013, but I hope to make it back
        to Hong Kong some day to see how much it has changed.</p>

      <p> In Asia I have visited the following countries:</p>
      <ul>
          <li> China </li>
          <li> Macau </li>
          <li> Thailand (3 times!) </li>
          <li> Indonesia </li>
          <li> Malaysia </li>
          <li> Singapore </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Africa </h3>
      <p> I visited Africa in 2011 while my boyfriend was teaching English
        there.  He was in Tanzania, living in a town called Moshi at the base
        of Mt. Kilimanjaro.  We went on safaris in Tanzania, took an 8 hour bus
        across the country to visit the island paradise of Zanzibar, and spent
        time with Masaai tribe members.</p>

      <h3> North America </h3>
      <p> Born in Colorado, raised in Minnesota, schooled in Wisconson, and adulting in Chicago.
         Yet to travel Canada, but <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/ab/banff/index.aspx">Banff</a> is on my list.
         I've visited Mexico three times for fun in the sun.
         I love visiting new areas of the U.S., such as my recent trip to Charleston.</p>

      <h3> South America </h3>
      <p> Coming soon! </p>

      <h3> Antarctica </h3>
      <p> Coming soon! </p>

      <h3> Europe </h3>
      <p> I visited Europe for the first time with my friends in 2008. My parents
        then treated me to a Parisian adventure for graduation in 2009. I can't
        wait to visit many other parts of Europe.</p>

      </ul>

      <h3> Australia </h3>
      <p> In 2014 I won an award at Google that gave me a free trip to anywhere
        in the world I wanted to go! I chose to visit Australia and New Zealand
        and it was one of the best trips of my life.</p>
